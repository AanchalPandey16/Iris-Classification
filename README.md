# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification Project

This project is a beginner-level **machine learning classification task** using the classic **Iris flower dataset**. The goal is to predict the species of an Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on its petal and sepal measurements.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
- **Dataset Used**: Scikit-learnâ€™s built-in Iris dataset
- **Tools & Libraries**: 
  - `Pandas` for data handling
  - `Seaborn` & `Matplotlib` for data visualization
  - `Scikit-learn` for model training & evaluation
- **Model Used**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Classification Report, Confusion Matrix

## ðŸ“Š What I Did
- Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.
- Cleaned and prepared the data using pandas.
- Visualized relationships using scatterplots, boxplots, and heatmaps.
- Trained a machine learning model using RandomForestClassifier.
- Evaluated performance using classification metrics.
- Visualized a decision tree from the forest for explainability.

## ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
- Achieved **high accuracy** on the test dataset.
- Visualized predictions and decision paths.

## ðŸš€ Output Highlights
- Visuals: Heatmap, boxplot, pairplot, tree diagram
- Final output: Predicted flower species based on input features

## ðŸ”„ Learning in Progress

Iâ€™m currently learning and practicing the following:
- ðŸ”¹ More machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes.
- ðŸ”¹ Data preprocessing techniques (scaling, encoding, handling missing data).
- ðŸ”¹ Real-world EDA and working with larger, messier datasets.
- ðŸ”¹ Building more machine learning projects (regression, clustering, NLP).
- ðŸ”¹ SQL for querying datasets.
- ðŸ”¹ Visualization dashboards with Power BI/Tableau.

This project is part of my **Data Science learning journey**, and more projects will be added soon!
